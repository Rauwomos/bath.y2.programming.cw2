Task 1 is solved correctly and with no multiple answers.
Task 2 is not solved because predicate s2/2 does not exist.
Task 3 is not solved because predicate s3/2 does not exist.
Task 4 is not solved because predicate s4/2 does not exist.
Task 5 is not solved because predicate s4/2 does not exist.
The grades for tasks 1 to 5 are: 20 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20.
No built-ins found.
The penalty for multiple answers is 0.
The final grade is therefore 20.
The marker will inspect the program for soundness and fairness and might change the grade.
